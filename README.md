# Octree Visualization
To run the project type the following commands:
```bash
$ cmake -B build
$ cd build
$ make
$ ./octree-visualization
```
You can use the mouse and arrow keys within the visualization window.
The default value of the **depth** variable in the `main.cpp` file is 7. If this value decreases fewer cubes are produced, and therefore, the resolution of the object also decreases.
